# Vocalype Brain — Current State

Last updated: 2026-04-25
Latest commit: ea2d218 — feat(brain): add V9 manual content tracker
Brain phase: V9 CLOSED — V10 design approved to begin

---

## Phase

**V9 CLOSED — Distribution Measurement Infrastructure complete. V10 design approved to begin.**
V9 Phase 1 scripts built and validated. Real content entry is a recurring founder task (after each post).
V10 = Unified Decision Engine — joins V7 + V8 + V9 by period key to answer: "Is the bottleneck product, funnel, or distribution?"
Next: use exact prompt from `v9_closure_report.md` Section 11 to begin V10 design.
V10 cannot run until all three layers (V7/V8/V9) have ≥4 weeks of real data.

V8 status: CLOSED. Infrastructure complete. Real business observations = 0 (founder Monday session pending).
V8 real data needed: record weekly metrics from Stripe / Supabase / Vercel each Monday (10 min).

## What Works Right Now

- Night Shift: 5-cycle proposal loop, proposal_only mode, local Ollama (qwen3:8b)
- Task classification: `planning_only` / `measurement_task` / `implementation_task`
- Codex task generation: measurement prompt, planning prompt, implementation prompt
- Quality signal tracking and scoring
- Post-implementation review via git diff
- Memory retrieval via embeddings + keyword match
- Full V2 loop validated: night_shift → classify → prompt → execute → review → commit
- **V3 — Safe Patch generation**: `generate_safe_patch.py` classifies target files and creates a patch proposal in `vocalype-brain/patches/`
- **V3 — Safe Patch review**: `review_safe_patch.py` summarizes the latest patch candidate and recommends next action
- **V3.5 — Apply Approved Patch**: `apply_approved_patch.py` applies `brain_safe`/`docs_safe` patches with `--approve`; dry-run by default; refuses product/unsafe patches; requires `## Apply Instructions` section in patch file
- **V5 — Product Patch Proposal**: `generate_product_patch_proposal.py` selects best frontend candidate, writes structured proposal + copy-pasteable implementation prompt; `review_product_patch_proposal.py` summarises and recommends next action

- **V6 — Product Implementation Handoff Loop**: `generate_handoff_task.py` reads approved proposal, runs 9 safety gates, extracts read-only code context, classifies task, writes `outputs/handoff_task.md`; `review_handoff_task.py` reviews latest record and recommends next action

- **V7 — Real Product Benchmark Loop**: Design plan at `outputs/v7_design_plan.md` — 13-section benchmark architecture covering latency, RAM, WER, activation stability, first dictation. Phase 1 = manual sessions. Phase 2 = baseline lock + comparison scripts.

- **V7 Phase 1 — Manual Benchmark Recorder**: `add_benchmark_observation.py` (CLI recorder) + `review_benchmarks.py` (report generator). Both validated. First observation recorded (`total_dictation_latency_ms = 2400ms`, first_dictation, parakeet, windows_4060). Waiting for ≥5 observations per priority metric.

## What Does Not Exist Yet

- `v10_design_plan.md` — V10 design (approved to begin)
- `correlate_content_business.py` — V9 Phase 2 script (not yet built)
- `correlate_content_business.py` — V9 Phase 2 script (designed, not yet built)
- `compare_content_experiments.py` — V9 Phase 3 script (not yet designed)
- `lock_business_baseline.py` — V8 Phase 2 script (designed, not yet built)
- `fetch_business_metrics.py` — V8 Phase 2 automated pull script (designed, not yet built)
- `correlate_metrics.py` — V8 Phase 2 V7×V8 correlation script (designed, not yet built)
- `data/business_baseline.jsonl` — V8 locked baseline (not yet created)
- `lock_benchmark_baseline.py` — V7 Phase 2 script (designed, not yet built)
- `compare_benchmarks.py` — V7 Phase 2 script (designed, not yet built)
- `benchmark_baseline.jsonl` — V7 locked baseline (not yet created)
- `paste_mechanism_diagnosis.md` — V7 read-only investigation output (not yet run)
- `idle_background_transcription_diagnosis.md` — V7 Track B output (not yet run)
- Event tracking — no instrumentation in product code (separate V7.5 task if needed)

## V3 Safety Classes

| Class | Meaning | Patch file created? |
|---|---|---|
| `brain_safe` | Only `vocalype-brain/` files | Yes — Markdown proposal |
| `docs_safe` | Only README/docs/markdown | Yes — Markdown proposal |
| `product_proposal_only` | Product code involved | Yes — TEXT ONLY, never auto-applied |
| `unsafe` | Forbidden scope detected | No — rejection logged |

Forbidden scope (always blocked in V3):
`backend/`, `src-tauri/`, `src/lib/auth/client.ts`, `src/lib/license/client.ts`, payment, billing, security, translation.json

---

## North Star Metric

`successful_dictations_per_active_user_per_week`
Activation event: `first_successful_dictation`
Current baseline: unknown — manual observation required

---

## Top Active Quality Risks

1. `activation_failed` retry button added — manual test pending (all 5 activation states) — MEDIUM
2. Auto-refresh loop (8 × 2500ms) may exhaust before license propagates — MEDIUM (retry button now resets counter)
3. `isExpectedMissingLicenseMessage` may silently suppress real errors — MEDIUM

## Operating Contract

Future prompts may reference the contract instead of repeating safety rules:
> "Follow `vocalype-brain/memory/operating_contract.md`."

## Top Recommended Next Actions

1. **Design V10 Unified Decision Engine** (next Brain session):
   - Use exact prompt from `vocalype-brain/outputs/v9_closure_report.md` Section 11
   - Creates: `v10_design_plan.md`

2. **Record real content observations** (after each post — founder task):
   - After publishing: `python vocalype-brain/scripts/add_content_observation.py --platform <p> --content_type <t> --hook "<h>" --niche <n> --target_user "<u>" --cta "<c>" --period <YYYY-Www> --source manual_founder`
   - 24–72h later: add `--views`, `--likes`, `--saves`, `--lesson`, `--next_action` to same script with `--record_type performance_update`
   - Review: `python vocalype-brain/scripts/review_content_performance.py`
   - Snapshot: `python vocalype-brain/scripts/weekly_content_snapshot.py`

2. **Record real V8 business observations** (10-min weekly session — founder task):
   - Open Stripe → record `mrr`, `paid_conversions`, `trial_starts`, `churned_users`, `refunds`
   - Open Supabase → record `account_signups`, `activation_attempts`, `first_successful_dictations`
   - Open Vercel → record `website_visitors`, `downloads`
   - Record each: `python vocalype-brain/scripts/add_business_observation.py --metric <m> --value <v> --unit <u> --source <s> --period <YYYY-Www>`
   - Review: `python vocalype-brain/scripts/review_business_metrics.py`

3. **V7 product investigations** (parallel track, lower priority until V9 Phase 1 done):
   - Track A: read-only investigation of `src-tauri/src/actions/paste.rs` → `paste_mechanism_diagnosis.md`
   - Track B: read-only investigation of audio manager → `idle_background_transcription_diagnosis.md`

## Validated Safety Rules (do not remove)

- `allow_product_code_modifications: false` — Brain never writes product code directly
- Night Shift is `proposal_only` — cannot apply patches
- `FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS` blocks backend/, src-tauri/, auth/client.ts, license/client.ts
- Scope reduction enforces frontend-first before any implementation prompt
- Score < 25 or risk = high → `planning_only` classification, no implementation
- `measurement_task` classification → plan file only, no product code
- V3: `unsafe` safety class → no patch file generated, rejection logged
- V3: `product_proposal_only` → patch file is text only, never auto-applied
- V3.5: `--approve` required for any write; dry-run by default
- V3.5: requires `## Apply Instructions` section; refuses if missing
- V3.5: resolves and validates absolute path before any write
- `--no-verify` is never used on commits

- CEO / Critic: qwen3:8b
- Coder: qwen2.5-coder:7b
- Embeddings: nomic-embed-text
- Fast: qwen3:4b (fallback: qwen3:8b)
- `keep_alive: 0` on all roles (models unloaded after each call)
